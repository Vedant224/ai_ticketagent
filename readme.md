## Technologies Used

The project is built with a modern stack, combining robust backend services with powerful AI capabilities:

- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT
- **Background Jobs:** Inngest (for event-driven workflows and durable functions)
- **AI Integration:** Google Gemini API (for intelligent ticket analysis and processing)
- **Email:** Nodemailer with Mailtrap (for email testing)
- **Development:** Nodemon (for hot reloading)

## How It Works

The AI Ticket Agent operates through a streamlined process:

1.  **Ticket Creation:** A user submits a support ticket with a title and description. The system records the initial ticket.
2.  **AI Processing:** An `on-ticket-created` event is triggered via Inngest. An AI agent (powered by Google Gemini) analyzes the ticket content to generate:
    - Required skills for resolution.
    - A priority level.
    - Helpful notes for the assigned moderator.
3.  **Moderator Assignment:** The system searches for moderators with skills matching the ticket's requirements. If a match is found, the ticket is assigned; otherwise, it falls back to administrator assignment.
4.  **Notification:** An email notification containing ticket details and AI-generated notes is sent to the assigned moderator.
5.  **Resolution:** The moderator addresses the ticket and resolves it, updating the system accordingly.

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vedant224/aiticketagent.git
    cd aiticketagent
```
  2.  **Install Dependencies:** Navigate into both `ai-ticket-assistant` and `ai-ticket-frontend` directories and install their respective dependencies:

  3.  **Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the `ai-ticket-assistant` directory and configure the following:

```bash
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    MAILTRAP_SMTP_HOST=your_mailtrap_host
    MAILTRAP_SMTP_PORT=your_mailtrap_port
    MAILTRAP_SMTP_USER=your_mailtrap_user
    MAILTRAP_SMTP_PASS=your_mailtrap_password
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    APP_URL=http://localhost:your_frontend_port
```

4.  **Run the Application:**

    Start the backend server:

    bash
    npm run dev
    npm run inngest-dev
    1.  Access the application through your web browser at the specified `APP_URL`.
2.  Register a new user or log in with existing credentials.
3.  Submit a new support ticket with a descriptive title and detailed description.
4.  Monitor the ticket's progress as it is processed by the AI and assigned to a moderator.
5.  Admins can manage users, roles, and skills via the admin interface.

## Troubleshooting

AI Processing Errors:

- Verify your `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file.
- Check your Google Gemini API quota and limits.
- Validate the request format being sent to the AI API.

Email Issues:

- Verify your Mailtrap credentials and SMTP settings.
- Monitor Mailtrap's email delivery logs for any errors.
